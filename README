########## Objectives ########################################################################################

1- remove all water except of chemisorbed water (Fe-Ow < 2.6 Ang); keep the chemisorbed water intact .

2- remove (OH)⁻ but keep track on how much you have removed 

3- remove ALL Fe-O (dummy bonds) including those to OH and O 

4- separate the clusters

5- keep separate clusters intact at the periodic boundries


########### Solution ##########################################################################################

1- Fe-O and Fe-(OH) bonds were assigned by using using TopoTools  (a-reconstruct_beforeMin.tcl)

#2- After using TopoTools- which erases bond and angle coefficients, bond and angle coefficients were assigned (b-reconstruct_beforeMin.sh)

#3- TopoTools reallocates bonds and angles, because of the reallocation procedure some of the bond types were changed from type 3 to type 2. These were corrected by using different ff_param files.

4- After obtaining the minimized geometry, dummy bond (bond type 3) were converted back to bond type 2 (a1-fix_bondError.tcl or search_and_replace.txt)

5- All of the water except the chemisorbed water (Fe-Ow < 2.6 Ang) was assigned to atom type 7-  in order to be removed. (a2-reconstruct.tcl)

6- Type 7 atoms were deleted (b-reconstruct.lmp)

7- Bonds and angles were analyzed to check if there was any issue. (c-analyze_topology.tcl). 

8- For the results, different atom types were written out to the .log file. Wandering (OH)- and (H)+ atoms were assinged as atom type 7- to be deleted. (d-colloid_data.tcl)

9- Free (OH) molecules were assigned to atom type 7 in order to be deleted and also the .log file file contains stuff that Robert asked for. (d-colloid_data.tcl)

10- Type 7 atoms are deleted (e-reconstruct.lmp)

11- Minimization results were read (*min.log) and potential energy (E_Pot) was scraped from log files and then added to the result data. (read_energy.sh)

12- Bonds between fe and O atoms are defined by using topotools. Bonds which are stretching over the periodic boundaries are connected. After obtaining the final connected structure bonds were erased (f-combine.tcl). 

13- Clusters were assigned (g-cluster.tcl).

1- Fe-O and Fe-(OH) bonds were assigned and subsequently deleted by using using TopoTools (delbonds)  (a-reconstruct_beforeMin.tcl)

2 -TopoTools reallocates bonds and angles, because of the reallocation procedure some of the bond types were changed from type 2 to type 3, in order to check if everything is correct (c-analyze_topology.tcl)

3- After obtaining the minimized geometry, dummy bond (bond type 3) were converted back to bond type 2 (search_and_replace.txt)

4- All of the water except the chemisorbed water (Fe-Ow < 2.6 Ang) was assigned to atom type 7-  in order to be removed. (a2-reconstruct.tcl)

5- Type 7 atoms were deleted (b-reconstruct.lmp)

6- Molecular topology was checked (c1-analyze_topology.tcl)

7- For the results, different atom types were written out to the .log file. Wandering (OH)- and (H)+ atoms were assinged as atom type 7- to be deleted. (d-colloid_data.tcl)

8- Type 7 atoms are deleted (yes-delete.lmp and no-delete.lmp )

9- Residual entries of "7 atom types" and "Masses....7 1" are deleted (search_and_replace.txt)

10- Individual clusters are assigned (g-cluster.lmp)

11- For each cluster a new data file is constructed (h_segragate.tcl)

12- Molecules which are streching at PBC brought to the middle of PBC box and (i_merge.sh)

13- modify.txt
